Introduction to Node.js
=======================

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with the basic initialisation of a Node.js project, its modular set-up, and Grunt as a task-automation aid.  Within Grunt, we made use of JSHint and Watch to ensure best practice and consistency in the format of our code.  We learnt how to integrate Jasmine-Node for unit-testing purposes.
